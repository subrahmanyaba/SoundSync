# SoundSync üîä

**SoundSync** is a Chrome extension that intelligently manages media volume across browser tabs. The active (focused) tab retains its original volume, while all other audible tabs are smoothly dimmed to avoid distractions.

‚ú® Includes a draggable override button that lets you take full control instantly!
