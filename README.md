# SoundSync 🔊

**SoundSync** is a Chrome extension that intelligently manages media volume across browser tabs. The active (focused) tab retains its original volume, while all other audible tabs are smoothly dimmed to avoid distractions.

✨ Includes a draggable override button that lets you take full control instantly!

- 🧠 Remembers user-changed volume per tab.
- 🟡 Override mode to disable auto volume control and reset all tabs.
- 🌈 Draggable floating overlay button with glow effect.

## 🛠️ Development Notes

- Uses `background.js` for tab tracking and messaging.
